# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project implements a **fraud detection system** using machine learning, with real-time alerting and experiment tracking for professional-grade model management.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Performed EDA to uncover patterns and anomalies, improving understanding of transaction behavior for better model insights.

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  Cleaned and preprocessed data, including feature engineering, resulting in higher model accuracy and reliability.

- **Modeling:**  
  Built and evaluated four ML models. **LightGBM** achieved the best results, enabling precise fraud detection.

- **Real-time Alerts:**  
  Implemented **Slack notifications** for high-risk transactions, providing immediate alerts to relevant teams for rapid fraud review.
